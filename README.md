# Intro
This project was the evaluation of out introduction class to devloppment through a game engine, we were a groupe of 4 and had 1.5 month for it.

# Context and Concept
One of the prerequisites of the project was that the game had to be developed in 3D. After a random draw, we were assigned the themes of ports and beaches. Based on these themes, we decided to adapt the board game "Battleship" into a 3D video game.

# Learning and development
Throughout this project, we explored and implemented various aspects of game development, including:
- Writing and managing scripts for game logic.
- Implementing camera movements to enhance gameplay experience.
- Creating and integrating animations for dynamic visuals.
- Designing and developing the UI (User Interface).
- Programming interactions between game elements.
- Managing other essential features of game development.
- 
To achieve these objectives, we relied on free assets for the development of the project, allowing us to focus on the mechanics and functionality of the game.
